# Behat Example

This is just a quick example to show how Behat can be used to test a few pages in a basic PHP website

## Usage

Clone it to somewhere with a web server, then run Composer to install Behat and other packages

You may need to change the base URL specified in behat.yml, as currently it (crudely) assumes it will be:

http://localhost/BehatExample/web/

*(as if you cloned it into your local web root)*
